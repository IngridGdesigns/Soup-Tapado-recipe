            <ol>
                <li>If you can, make fresh coconut milk! (Otherwise use 2 cans of coconut milk.)
                    To make it from scratch, crack open the coconuts with a hammer. Grind down the flesh of both brown coconut into shreds.
                    Measure the amount of shredded coconut that was yielded and begin warming double the amount of water. 
                    Add warm water to shredded coconut and massage with hands thoroughly for several minutes. Then strain out the coconut 
                    into a bowl, squeezing by hand or using a cheesecloth every bit of liquid out of the shreds to maximize the coconut flavor. 
                    Discard the strained coconut and retain the coconut milk that was just created.
